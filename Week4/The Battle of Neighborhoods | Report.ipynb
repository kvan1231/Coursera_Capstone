    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to preform an analysis of Edmonton, the capital of Alberta. Edmonton is the second most populous city in the province with a touch under a million residents as of 2016 spread over 685.25 km$^2$. Being a decently sized city there are a wide range of venues with multiple universities, shopping centres and recreational areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be aiming to create an analysis using the techniques learned in the specialization to generate information useful to those who currently live in Edmonton and people interested in moving there. We will also generate information on what amenities are where for developers looking to start a business in Edmonton.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to determine the following properties about Edmonton:\n",
    "1. Which neighbourhood has the most schools?\n",
    "2. Which neighbourhood has the most recreational centers?\n",
    "3. Are there regions of the city where restaurants are more accessible?\n",
    "4. Are there regions of the city where grocery stores are more accessible?\n",
    "5. Is there an even distribution of furniture stores?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first four properties we will be trying to learn more about Edmonton directly influence where someone may choose to live in the city. Properties 3 and 4 would be more relevant to any developers in the food industry as entering an area with an over-abundance of either type of venue would be very difficult. Finally the last property would look at the number of furniture stores in Edmonton to determine if it would be reasonable to open a second Ikea in the area.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finding all of the furniture stores in Edmonton we can try to find any gaps in the map to determine if it is reasonable to open an additional Ikea.\n",
